At the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2025 in Barcelona, the company showed off a new “Screenshare” feature, which lets users share what’s on their phone’s screen with Gemini and ask questions about the company. As an example, the company showed a video of a user shopping for a pair of baggy jeans and asking Gemini what other clothing would pair well with it. As for the video search feature, Google had teasedit at Google I/O last year. The feature lets you take a video and ask Gemini questions about it as you’re filming. Google said these features will roll out to Gemini Advanced users on the Google One AI Premium plan on Android later this month.

After a five-week trial, the jury found Javice guilty, agreeing with prosecutors’ claims that she fabricated the vast majority of Frank’s customer list to deceive JPMorgan into acquiring her startup. When JPMorgan bought Frank in 2021, the bank thought the startup had 4 million customers. The bank found out that the actual customer count was only 300,000 when it later sent test marketing emails to alleged Frank users and approximately 70% of those messages bounced back. Javice allegedly hired amath professor to create fake customer data, which she submitted to JPMorgan when the bank was considering buying her company. Defense attorneys argued that the suit was a result of buyer’s remorse due to a government change in the way financial aid forms are filled out. Javice pleaded not guilty and didn’t take the stand during the trial. Javice, who is now 32, could be sentenced up to decades in prison. The sentencing is expected to take place in August,according to a CNBC report. Javice founded Frank in 2017 when she was in her mid-20s. In 2019, she was named to theForbes 30 Under 30 list.

Fintech VC powerhouse Frank Rotman stepping down from QED Investors to found his own startups,Mary Ann Azevedo,"2:13 PM PDT · March 28, 2025",Prolific fintech investor and QED Investors co-founder Frank Rotman said Friday that he will transition to a partner emeritus role by year’s end to focus,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Prolific fintech investor and QED Investors co-founder Frank Rotman said Friday that he will transition to a partner emeritus role by year’s end to focus on founding his own startups. But those startups won’t necessarily be financial technology companies. Ina post on X, Rotman — who helped start QED in 2007 — declared that “the first business” that he plans “on getting out of the ground is in the music industry.” He wrote: “It’s easy to call me crazy for all the obvious reasons, but it’s worth reserving judgment until you learn more about the business that’s evolved in my head and sat on the shelf for years. It will be fun to build and could actually make a huge difference to an industry that none of us could imagine living without.” Rotman started Alexandria, Virginia-based QED, which today has $4 billion in assets under management, nearly two decades ago with Nigel Morris and Caribou Honig. He led the firm’s investment in Credit Karma and played a role in QED’s investments in unicorns such as GreenSky, Flywire, and SoFi. (In fact, QED was the first institutional money into Credit Karma.) Other companies that the firm has backed include Creditas, Nubank, AvidXchange, and Bitso. QED exclusively invests in companies building financial technology at the pre-seed to Series A stages. Rotman, who goes by the handle “The Fintech Junkie” on X, said he will transition to his new role on January 1, 2026. He will continue to serve in a part-time advisory role to QED over the coming years. Besides founding music startups, Rotman said he likely plans to write a book centered around his “observations and frameworks for the startup and VC worlds.” He wrote in the X post: “This shouldn’t surprise anyone who knows me – writing is my oxygen. I can’t imagine a life without it even though ChatGPT and Claude are better writers than I am.” In a statement, QED Managing Partner Nigel Morris noted that he and Rotman had worked together for over 30 years — previously also at Capital One. “Frank, at his core, is an entrepreneur and I have no doubt he will excel in his next chapter,” he said. QED Investors’ partner Amias Gerety will be promoted to lead QED’s U.S. investment team.

Before we jump into the transportation news of the week, it’s worth pointing you to a couple of articles that are focused onElon Musk, the CEO and largest shareholder of Tesla and the founder of several other companies, including SpaceX and Neuralink. You might recall an investigation the team here at TechCrunch published in February on thepeople in Elon Musk’s DOGE universe. The article, which continues to be updated, focused on those working for theDepartment of Government Efficiency, an entity established via President Trump’s executive order. A new report, by another team here at TechCrunch, focuses on thefounders and VCs working with DOGE. Check it out! Speaking of Musk, his close allyTrumphas placed 25% tariffs on all cars imported to the United States, including those from Mexico and Canada. He’s also placed a 25% tariff on certain parts used to build cars. As reporter Sean O’Kane notes, it’s a decision that will likely supercharge the cost of new and used cars, but it’salso a gift to Tesla, the company run by Musk, his biggest financial supporter in the presidential election. And finally, in other am-I-in-a-simulation news,Trevor Milton, the founder of bankrupt hydrogen trucking startup Nikola who was convicted of fraud, hasbeen pardoned by Trump, the White House confirmed to TechCrunch. Tidbit: We waited for hours and hours before the White House would confirm. OK, onward with the rest of the news of the week.

No financial terms were disclosed, but our soon-to-be previous owner Yahoo Holdings is maintaining a small share of ownership.

Getting the Gravity into customer hands is a big milestone for Lucid, whose success will hinge on being able to offer vehicle types popular with American drivers. The Gravity is Lucid’s second vehicle and its first SUV after theLucid Airsedan series. Lucid opened up orders for the seven-seater SUV in November 2024 and beganfirst deliveriesto employees, friends, and family in December. “We nearly finished building all the vehicles that we wanted to build to put them into our studio and for test drives,” Marc Winterhoff, interim CEO of Lucid, said Thursday evening at a brand activation event in New York City. “And by the end of April, we will resume customer deliveries of the Gravity.” 👀🛸 Check out@LucidMotorsnew Gravity SUV in NYC.pic.twitter.com/ejzhHqXsAe Lucid employees who spoke to TechCrunch at the event — which featured a surprise mini performance from Cautious Clay — confirmed that the EV maker is busy ramping up Gravity production at its Casa Grande, Arizona factory. Barring any hiccups, that U.S.-based factory will no doubt be a boon for the EV startup amid President Donald Trump’snew 25% auto tariffs. The $94,900 Gravity has an official EPA range estimate of 450 miles and the performance of a sports car, which the company attributes to its advanced battery technology that allows for a denser, lighter-weight battery that packs a punch. “With the Lucid Gravity, you don’t have to compromise. You can have it all,” Winterhoff said. Topics Senior Reporter, Transportation Rebecca Bellan covers transportation for TechCrunch.

Nikola founder Trevor Milton pardoned by Trump,Sean O'Kane,"6:49 AM PDT · March 28, 2025","Trevor Milton, the founder of bankrupt hydrogen trucking startup Nikola who was convicted of fraud, has been pardoned by President Trump, the White House","Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Trevor Milton, the founder of bankrupt hydrogen trucking startup Nikola who was convicted of fraud, has been pardoned by President Trump, the White House confirmed to TechCrunch. Milton was convicted in October 2022 of one count ofsecurities fraudand two counts of wire fraud related to claims he made about Nikola’s progress to investors. He wassentencedto four years in prison in December 2023. He has been out on a $100 million bond while he appealed that sentence. The pardon comes just a few weeks after Nikolafiled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company has been working with the bankruptcy court in Delaware to try tosell the business, and had hoped to close such a deal by mid-April. “It is no wonder why trust and confidence in the Justice Department has eroded to nothing. I wish judges would stop believing whatever the prosecutors feed them so Americans could trust the justice system again,” Milton said in a statement. Milton was convicted by a jury. He was represented in that trial by Brad Bondi, a partner at law firm Paul Hastings and the brother of current U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. Now a free man, Milton has said he plans to release a documentary that he believes will tell his side of the Nikola story. Milton founded Nikola in 2014. The company didn’t enter the spotlight until 2020, when it became one of the first electric vehicle companies to go public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). It quickly became a hotly traded stock, especially after General Motors announced a$2 billion stake in September of that year. The company’s circumstances quickly changed, though. Just days after GM’s announcement, short-selling research firm Hindenburg Research published a report containing allegations of fraud perpetrated by Milton. The Securities and Exchange Commissionopened an investigation, and GMwalked away from the deal. Milton ultimately resigned, although during his sentencing hearing in 2023 he claimed hestepped down to help his ailing wife. Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York charged Milton inJuly 2021, claiming that he had made “false and misleading statements regarding Nikola’s product and technology development,” on social media and in TV, print, and podcast interviews. They said Milton made these claims in order to “induce retail investors to purchase Nikola stock.” After he was convicted, a judge ordered Milton topay his former company nearly $168 millionfollowing an arbitration casebetween the two sides. That money was supposed to factor into Nikola’s bankruptcy case. Nikola planned to use those proceeds to settle a class action lawsuit against the company filed by shareholders.
